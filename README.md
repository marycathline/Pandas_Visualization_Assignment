# 🌸 Data Visualization with Iris Dataset

This repository contains an interactive Jupyter Notebook that explores and visualizes the classic Iris flower dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📁 Contents

- `pandas.ipynb` - The main notebook with step-by-step data analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md` - This file.

## 📊 Visualizations Included

The notebook performs the following tasks:

1. **Loading and inspecting the dataset**  
   - Dataset loaded from `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
   - Checked for missing or infinite values
   - Cleaned the data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics by species
   - Grouped means of numerical features

3. **Data Visualizations**
   - Line chart: Petal length trend per species
   - Bar chart: Average sepal width per species
   - Histogram: Petal length distribution
   - Scatter plot: Sepal length vs. petal length

All charts are customized for readability and aesthetics. Legends are positioned outside the plot area using `bbox_to_anchor`.
